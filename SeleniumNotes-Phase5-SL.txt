What is testing?

 verify the code written is as per the requirements of the user

 find bugs in the code written so that application deleveloped as per the given requirement

 to check actual results match to expected req

why testing?

 > find bugs in the written code

 > improve the quality of the code

 > find defect early, its easy to fix and less cost


Types of testing:


 Manual testing: testing your application manually step by step by a tester

  > time consuming
  > repetition - boring
  > chance of error
  > missed testing the req
  > quality will be less
  > cost will be more

Automation Testing: execute the test cases but using an automation tool

  > fatser

  > repetitive task can be performed easily with automation tool

  > less mistakes and quality of testing will be better

  > cost will less

  > schedule the testing on desired time


 Automation tool : selenium


Features:

 functional testing and regression
 selenium tool is a java based
 Open source tool, free
 WEb app testing, mobile platform testing
 Selenium support testing on multiple browser: chrome, IE, edge, FF, safari
 Test Scripts for testing
 Selenium support multiple programming language: JAVA, python, ruby, C#, php
 Platform independent tool : windows, mac & linux

Componenets of Selenium : set of tools
***************

Selenium IDE :
*******************
Used for testing webapplication
it is a plugin or extension to be added on chrome browser or FF browser
its has a dashboard, you record your test cases of an application, and then play it back
Simple and easy to work with tool of selenium
record and playback tool
No complex testing can be done with IDE
No programming skills needed to use this tool

Disadvantages:
*******************
 you cannot run your test cases with huge test data
 you cannot pass test data from csv file or excel sheet to IDE
 you cannot do cross browser testing
 manually update the chnages and record the scenario
 no wait time can be added in IDE

Selenium WebDriver: JAVA
*********************

> heart of selenium, main component of selenium
> automation testing
> using selenium webdriver, we write scripts in different programmign language to automate the test cases or functionalities
> webdriver is just a set of libraries (Interface, classes, methods) files that help you to automate
> Complex testing can be performed
> webdriver when intgrated with testing framework tools like testng, junit, cusumber, extent reports and so on..
> plan the execution of test cases: prioritze test cases, group your test cases
> selenium can be integrated with DEVOPS tools: git hub, Maven , jenkins , docker : continous testing
> pass test data from csv file or excel sheet to your test scripts
> Synchronize the tool to wait for certain time with your application: 2 types of wait time: implicit wait & explicit wait
> screenshots of test cases failure
> parallel testing, cross browser testing at the same time

Installation:  JAVA version <= 1.8 , eclipse latest, selenium webdriver library



Selenium GRID

execute the selenium test cases in a distributed format

using GRID we set up a hub and multiple node environment

using webdriver ---> supply tets script --> GRID HUB---> distribute your script to a node for execution

> parallel testing, cross browser testing at the same time


Selenium RC

remote control : deprecated




 Agenda: Day 2
************

 Install and set up selenium client
 download selenium driver - chrome driver
 Write test scripts --> automate browser, nagation to different webpages
 Locator selenium
 Web elements testing



 


 Install and set up selenium client :

 pls check java is availabel on your machine - available

 Install eclipse --> available 
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (includes Incubating components)


Install selenium client :

  Manually : 
you selenium website and download the java client libraries in your local machine
https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
Create a java project in eclipse
Go to configure build step
add the libraries/jar to your java project

OR

Using maven dependencies

 go to eclipse--> create a simple Maven project

 Go to FILE---> project---> MAVEN---> MAVEN project---> select Create simple project---> select the workspace

 you will go to the pom file and add selenium-java dependencies, TestNG

 <dependencies>
  
  <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java -->
<dependency>
<groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
<artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
<version>3.141.59</version>
</dependency>
   <dependency>
            <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
            <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
            <version>6.14.3</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
        </dependencies>

 save the pom file

************************************
Install the chrome driver

***********************

browser is Chrome

check the version of chrome browser

go to browser-- help--about google chrome

and note the installed version : Version 100

Whatever is your browser version --- same should be the version of selenium chrome driver installed

Go to https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/

scroll down down to browser section ---> go to chrome --> click on documentation

***************************


- WebElements

WebPage consist of multiple webelements

> inputbox, textbox
 action :  enabled or not , enter data
> buttons, submit

action : button is enabled or not, click

> checkbox, radiobutton
action : checkbox is enabled or not, click/select

> dropdown, dynamic drop down

action : list the values, select the value from the list
> tables

action : how many rows, how many columes, fetch value from the cell
> Images

action : click
> Links

action : link is enabled or not, click

> data pciker

select a date


We will use selenium to test these webelements
for this, 

selenium goes to the webpage and find the desired element on the webpage and perform an action on it

Locators:

locators are nothing but address of elements

Every element on the webpage has some attributes associated to it, using these attributes you can find the address of the elements

Testing an element using selenium


Step1 : find the attributes of an element


Step2: find the locator value

Locators in selenium are :

every locator will get a value from element attribute

id    : id attribute

name : name attribute

tagName : tag of the element

className: class attribute

xPath

CSS

linktext : inner text of element

partialLinktext


<input name="search" type="search" size="20" autofocus="autofocus" accesskey="F" dir="auto" autocomplete="off" style="padding-right: 64px;">


find the element using ID locator and its value is going to be searchInput

find the element using name locator and its value is going to be search


Step 3: perform the action on the element

sendkeys()
Click()

*************************

Day 3: Agenda:

 > learn about XPATH locator and its axex
 > Using XPATH, we will test checkboxes, radio buttons, tables & drop down
 > how to handle dynamic elements on webpage
 > learn about CSS selector locator
 > Wait time in selenium


 1. learn about XPATH locator and its axex
************
It is one of the most commonly used locator in selenium

XPATH stands for xml expression path

XPATH is an expression that you will use to find an element on the webpage

XPATH is a syntax, which one will write to find an element or elements on a webpage


HTML document nodes:

Root NOde	XpathNode that contains entire document is called as root node
Element Node	Represt a WebElement. Defined between <> </>
Attribute	Defines the feature of a particular element node
Text Node	ANy node which containes text for an element it is called as text node
Comment	        Contains some text to provide additional info
Processing Instruction	"<? xmlversion =""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>details about xml version and encoding"


XPATH : 2 types

Absolute xpath: reach the desired element using the tags of the html document

Complete path of travelling between your html document from the very first tag to the tag of the desired element(element that we want to locate).

 /html/body/div[3]/div/div/a

/html/body/div[3]/form/fieldset/input
/html/body/div[3]/form/fieldset/button


Relative xpath
***************

  Syntax : //tagname[@attribute='value']



  //input[@id='searchInput']

 //button[@type='submit']

 //*[@type='submit']


After writing relative xpath if you get one of many as the output on finder then use index value to select your specific node

 (//tagname[@attribute='value'])[index]


XPATH functions:

text() : this function is used find text nodes on the webpage

syntax:

 //tagname[text()='full text value']

 //span[text()='Main page']

If there are 2 elements with the same text value, you can write the text() function XPATH and then use index

  (//*[text()='About Wikipedia'])[2]



 //*[text()='S&P BSE MidCap']



2. starts-with()

  //tagname[starts-with(@attributeName,starting characters)]

starts-with() is a function that can find an element based on the starting value of the attribute


when we compare relative xpath:

//tagname[@attribute='value']

3. Contains()

 //tagname[contains(@attributeName,sub string value)]

Find the tags with attribute value containing the provided sub string value in xpath



XPATH Axis:



 > child

 synatx : //tagname[@attribute='value']/axixname::tagname

find all the children for a parent tag

  parentTag relativeXPATh/child::*

find all the children with tag name as div for a parent tag

parentTag relativeXPATh/child::div

Example: 

(//*[@class='Example'])[1]/child::*

 > descendant

  synatx : //tagname[@attribute='value']/axixname::tagname

find all the tags(child, grandchild) for a parent tag

  parentTag relativeXPATh/descendant::*

   parentTag relativeXPATh/child::specifictagname[index]
 
self	return the same current tag
child	will return all the children of the current node
parent	Will retrun the parent tag of the current node
ancestor	selects all the ancestors of the context node
ancestor-or-self	selects all the ancestors of the context node and itself
descendant	will return all the children and grandchildren of the current node
descendant-or-self	will return all the children of the current node and itself
following	will return all the nodes that apppear after the current node ends
following-sibling	"will return all the nodes that have :
1. same parent as the current node
2. appear after the conext node"
preceding	will return all the nodes that appear before parent  of the context node and travelling through the root node
preceding sibling	"will return all the nodes that have :
1. same parent as the current node
2. appear before the conext node"




*************************************

CSS selector Locator using tag & id attribute

Synatx: tagname#value of id attribute

input#searchInput


CSS selector Locator using tag & class attribute

Synatx: tagname.value of class attribute

div.search-input



CSS selector Locator using tag and any other attribute


tagname[attributeName=value]



CSS selector Locator using tag and inner text (link)


tag:contains("innertext")


#pt-login > a > span
